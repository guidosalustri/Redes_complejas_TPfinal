# Redes_complejas_TPfinal


This repository corresponds to a group analysis report made
for a course of my degree. From differential profiles of massive gene expression the idea
was to build networks of gene interactions and determine which transcriptional factors
were key (master regulators) in the transformation from basal cells to tumor phenotypes
of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). The data samples are RNASeq retrieved from the
TCGA database. The file ”Informe final.pdf” corresponds to the final report file.
